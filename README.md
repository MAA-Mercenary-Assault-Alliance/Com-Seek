# Com-Seek

## Background
As junior-year students in the Computer Engineering program at Kasetsart University, finding an internship is required to graduate, which is very important for the development of our careers and future goals. Kasetsart Computer Engineering alumni are known as reliable in the job market, but sometimes companies struggle to reach them directly.
